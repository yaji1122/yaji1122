A Taiwan Backend Programmer working in Travel Industry.

Using Grails as main framework for job, develope and maintain web application.

In my free time, I keep learning other languages like Go and some popular frontend library (React, Angular). Interesting in both backend and frontend programming.

Also have lots interest in ARM system (Raspberry Pi) and Penetration test (Ethical Hacker stuff).

So little time I have and so many stuff to learn right ?

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that I am capable of for improving my skills.
